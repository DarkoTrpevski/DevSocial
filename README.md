# DevCSocial
#Used this project to expand my knowledge about MERN stack. Used ReactJS and created a database(MongoDB) and its API routes from scratch using Node/Express. Then render them using ReactJS components.
#TODO: Some code cleanup in the client-side folder.

#To use this repo, you need to create a JSON file in config with your MongoDB and GitHub access tokens/secret keys, then connnect them in the db file.
